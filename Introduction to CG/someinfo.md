### Runtime information
Currently, the way that this code is being run is by a Linux Ubuntu environment. Write the program and compile in the terminal, similar to the method suggested in the Scratchapixel website.

To compile and run a program run terminal lines in this format:
```
g++ -o compilename foo.cpp
./compilename
```
After the first line a file called `compilename` will be instantiated, and can be run by the use of the second line in the terminal.
